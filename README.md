# Project Details: Analyze NYSE Data
 This is the 2nd project in Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree which used Google Sheets for analysis and modeling

As can be seen from the [Project Details](https://github.com/KOdoi-OJ/Analyze-NYSE-Data/blob/main/Project%20Details.pdf) file, the objectives of the project were to:
- conduct an [analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BG2cX7SGHGSofzVLkyz2uMv_PVxuzJzFdJxS1a3ygqY/edit?usp=sharing) of [Kaggle's NYSE S&P 500 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse) and create a [presentation](https://github.com/KOdoi-OJ/Analyze-NYSE-Data/blob/main/Project%20Presentation.pdf) to share findings,
- develop a dashboard for a [Profit and Loss Statement](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w32vCUmfyW5GFVh_oF6BAVNSLCaodztoQDC-3EM8r4o/edit?usp=sharing), and
- create a [Financial Forecasting Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zLQhnuJgtsaz7h7ckQvSwYCIH2Jw_LQ--e3OZLFlWY0/edit?usp=sharing) using three scenarios

The objectives (stated above) made up the Tasks to be completed.

Each linked Google Sheet file (Excel versions attached) features the dataset and the result of the task;
- Task 1: Summary Sheet with a visualization answering a question asked of the data
- Task 2: P/L Statement with dropdown list featuring the various companies
- Task 3: Financial model for a different company to forecast Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for 2 more years using 3 scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case); each with it's own assumptions

Overall, the project sought to assess the ability of the student to ask questions of a dataset, and answer them with relevant visualizations. It also put to practice the lessons on modeling in spreadsheets with assumptions, and business domain knowledge.
